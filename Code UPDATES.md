**DAY 1:** I created the Readme.md for the project and explained the main purposes and objectives of it. Added the first code of implementing the very basics of
       JavaSwing UI with a simple window opening up and showing the clients balance and a deposit button.\
       
**DAY 2:** I learned more about the Java Swing elements and how to use them properly such as JButton . I added a withdraw button.Also learned how to properly use
        withdrawBtn.addActionListener, which allows the application to listen to the user input and decide how to act taking advantage of the core logic i implemented.
        (Withdraw removes money and deposit adds to the balance variable declared.) But still this needs a bit of improvement since the balance also cant be negative or the 
        user cannot withdraw any money which exceeds the balance amount.\
**DAY 3:** Today i decided to improve further more the logic of the app some of the core functions of the withdraw button which does not allow the user to withdraw more money
       than the balance it currently has and it shows a dialog box using the command: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, "Balance is too low!");
       Also learned about the time library and also java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter; . Using these two libraries i managed to show a label text on the top right of my app          which contained the current date and time.My future plan for tomorrow is to implement a history log taking advantage of the specific time and date libraries i used so          that each transaction is shown alongside the time it happened.
