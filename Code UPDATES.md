**DAY 1:** I created the Readme.md for the project and explained the main purposes and objectives of it. Added the first code of implementing the very basics of
       JavaSwing UI with a simple window opening up and showing the clients balance and a deposit button.\
       
**DAY 2:** I learned more about the Java Swing elements and how to use them properly such as JButton . I added a withdraw button.Also learned how to properly use
        withdrawBtn.addActionListener, which allows the application to listen to the user input and decide how to act taking advantage of the core logic i implemented.
        (Withdraw removes money and deposit adds to the balance variable declared.) But still this needs a bit of improvement since the balance also cant be negative or the 
        user cannot withdraw any money which exceeds the balance amount.\
**DAY 3:** Today i decided to improve further more the logic of the app some of the core functions of the withdraw button which does not allow the user to withdraw more money
       than the balance it currently has and it shows a dialog box using the command: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, "Balance is too low!");
       Also learned about the time library and also java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter; . Using these two libraries i managed to show a label text on the top right of my app          which contained the current date and time.My future plan for tomorrow is to implement a history log taking advantage of the specific time and date libraries i used so          that each transaction is shown alongside the time it happened.\
**DAY 4:** Today i created a history log which shows the exact real time a transaction happened.I created a label for the history log and also used JScrollPane to make it
       possible to scroll down until the end of the transactions history.I realized that the time was not moving and stayed the same as the first time the application started.
       That so happened because i belive it treats the time date format as a string and does not continue to update it in real time,so my next step is to correct this bug and
       make it fully funcionable.\
**DAY 5** I coorected the bug of time showing wrong after a deposit or withdrawal. Also resized the window and made it a bit bigger to be able to show all history of transacions. Using a funcition of the timer class public void actionPerformed, we will be able to update the time each second giving us a more up to date value. My next goal is to create a download button which saves all the users transactions into a txt file.
**DAY 6** Added a download button which currently does nothing when pressed but working on making it fully usable to extract the history log into a .txt file. UPDATE- Made the Download History button work using imports of java.io.FileWriter and java.io.PrintWriter. Using those i was abble to print the first few lines of the Bank Statement into a txt file then using pw.print(historyLog.getText()); i got all the dettails of the historyLog pannel and pasted into the txt file. Also used try catch for any type of exeption or error we might interefeere during the way and made it so it shows the specific error on JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, ex.getMessage()); Plans for tomorrow are to create a login page since that is the most important security step   \
