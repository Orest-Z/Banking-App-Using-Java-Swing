DAY 1: I created the Readme.md for the project and explained the main purposes and objectives of it. Added the first code of implementing the very basics of
       JavaSwing UI with a simple window opening up and showing the clients balance and a deposit button.
DAY 2: I learned more about the Java Swing elements and how to use them properly such as JButton . I added a withdraw button.
