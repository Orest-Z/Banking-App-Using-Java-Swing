DAY 1: I created the Readme.md for the project and explained the main purposes and objectives of it. Added the first code of implementing the very basics of
       JavaSwing UI with a simple window opening up and showing the clients balance and a deposit button.
DAY 2: I learned more about the Java Swing elements and how to use them properly such as JButton . I added a withdraw button.Also learned how to properly use
        withdrawBtn.addActionListener, which allows the application to listen to the user input and decide how to act taking advantage of the core logic i implemented.
        (Withdraw removes money and deposit adds to the balance variable declared.) But still this needs a bit of improvement since the balance also cant be negative or the 
        user cannot withdraw any money which exceeds the balance amount.
